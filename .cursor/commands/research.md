Conduct thorough research on: $ARGUMENTS

<!-- requires: researcher, explorer -->
<!-- chains: none -->
<!-- generated from .ai/workflows/research.md; do not edit directly -->

> **Cursor:** run from the project root that contains `.cursor/`. Delegate to the subagents in `.cursor/agents/`; they share one working tree, so serialize file-modifying tasks.


**Always delegate to subagent(s)** — web search results are bulky and should not fill the main context window.

## Approach

Break the question into distinct facets and spawn parallel researcher subagents — one per facet — to investigate simultaneously. Each researcher searches independently in its own context and returns only structured findings. Synthesize their results in the main window.

For questions with both a technical and business dimension, run those as separate parallel tracks.

If codebase exploration is also needed, spawn explorer subagents in parallel with the researchers.

## Per-researcher instructions

Each researcher subagent should:
- Use multiple search queries to triangulate
- Cross-reference sources for accuracy
- Distinguish official docs from community advice from opinion
- Include source URLs for key claims

## Output

Synthesize all subagent findings into:

1. **Summary**: Direct answer to the research question (2-3 sentences)
2. **Key findings**: Organized by facet, with the most important points from each researcher
3. **Conflicting viewpoints**: Where sources disagree and which position is stronger
4. **Recommendations**: Actionable next steps based on the research
5. **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with brief justification (aggregate from researcher subagents)
6. **Sources**: URLs for the most authoritative references

Keep it concise and scannable. Bullets over prose.

### Next steps
- Run `/create-issue` to turn findings into actionable work
- Or run `/start-issue <#>` if an issue already exists for this topic
