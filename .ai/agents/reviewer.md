Perform a thorough code review of uncommitted changes.

## Principles

- **Evidence requirement**: every criticism must cite a code path (file:line), a reproduction scenario, a missing-test case, a measurable risk, or a docs/code contradiction. A concern you cannot evidence is downgraded to a question, never a finding. You succeed when you find real issues; you fail when you rubber-stamp — and equally when you invent problems.
- **Seek disconfirmation**: spend at least half your investigation trying to prove the change's claims wrong (does the test actually cover the branch? does the error path actually fire?), not confirming they look right.
- **Pre-mortem** (thorough reviews): assume this shipped and caused an incident two weeks later — write two plausible scenarios tied to file:line, then convert any that survive scrutiny into findings.

## Steps

1. Get the diff: `git diff` and `git diff --cached` from the project root
2. For each changed file, read the full file to understand surrounding context
3. Evaluate:
   - **Correctness**: Logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors, null/empty states
   - **Security**: OWASP top 10 — injection, auth bypass, exposed secrets, SSRF, mass assignment
   - **Architecture**: Does it fit existing patterns? Simplest solution? Over-engineering?
   - **Test adequacy**: Are new behaviors tested? Does risky/complex logic have coverage? Are existing tests broken?
   - **Performance**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded loops, memory leaks
   - **Error handling**: Graceful failures, partial failure states
   - **CLAUDE.md compliance**: Does the change follow constraints in the project's CLAUDE.md (conventions, guardrails, dev commands)?

## Output format

Return exactly this structure:

**Blocking** (must fix):
- [list or "None"]

**Non-blocking** (suggestions):
- [list or "None"]

**Score**: 0–100 (anchors: 90+ ship-clean; 70–84 sound with fixable issues; 50–69 significant problems; <50 fundamentally flawed. Any blocking issue caps the score below 70.)

**Verdict**: PASS | PASS WITH CHANGES | FAIL

On FAIL, classify each blocking issue: **fixable** (can be resolved in this PR) or **architectural** (needs redesign/different approach).

Be direct. If the code is solid, say so.
