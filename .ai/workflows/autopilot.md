Run the full autonomous pipeline for issue $ARGUMENTS. No human intervention required.

If no issue number is provided, pick the highest-priority open issue from `gh issue list --state open --repo <detected-repo>` (prefer bugs over enhancements, older over newer). If no open issues exist, run **Self-Triage** (Phase 0) to generate work.

## Autonomy Principles

- **Decide, don't ask.** Make reasonable assumptions and document them in the PR body. Only stop for irreversible risk (data loss, security, force-push).
- **Recover, don't report.** When something fails, try an alternative approach before escalating. Escalation is a last resort, not a first response.
- **Stop clean, not mid-flight.** Never leave uncommitted changes, half-done branches, or orphaned state. Every stopping point must be a valid checkpoint.
- **Create breadcrumbs.** When winding down, file issues for unfinished work so the next session can pick up seamlessly.

## Pipeline

`/autopilot` is a thin orchestrator. It chains the dedicated commands (`/start-issue`, `/ship`, `/finish`) end-to-end and adds the pre-flight orient + self-triage that those individual commands don't do. Each chained command preserves its own retry semantics, gates, and wind-down behavior.

### Phase 0: Self-Triage (only when no issues exist)

If no open issues are found:
1. Scan codebase for improvement opportunities:
   - `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX"` for flagged technical debt
   - Review CLAUDE.md for documented next steps
   - Check CHANGELOG.md for recent patterns suggesting follow-up work
   - Run explorer subagent(s) to identify code quality issues, missing tests, or architectural gaps
2. Rank findings by impact (bugs > missing tests > tech debt > enhancements)
3. Create the highest-impact issue via `gh issue create`
4. Continue pipeline with the newly created issue

### Phase 1: Orient
- Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` for recent context
- Detect repo via `git remote get-url origin`
- If working tree is dirty:
  - Stash changes: `git stash push -m "autopilot-pre-<issue-number>"`
  - Continue (do NOT stop to ask)

### Phase 2: Start the issue → `/start-issue <#>`

Run `/start-issue <#>`. It handles plan-critique loop, parallel coder subagents, implementation, and the test gate, and ends ready for `/ship`.

If `/start-issue` winds down early (`[WIP]`, `[BLOCKED]`, `[FAILING]` prefix on the draft PR it created), respect that wind-down — the breadcrumbs are filed; do not try to push past them.

### Phase 3: Ship → `/ship <#>`

Run `/ship <#>`. It runs the pre-push critique gate, runs all quality gates in parallel, updates CHANGELOG, pushes the branch, creates the PR, and auto-merges.

If `/ship` cannot auto-merge (branch protection, required reviewers): the PR is left open, the work is preserved, and `/ship` notes that manual merge is needed. Still run Phase 4 — `/finish` branches on PR state and performs safe cleanup for unmerged PRs without closing the issue or deleting the branch.

### Phase 4: Finish → `/finish <#>`

Run `/finish <#>`. It closes the issue, deletes branches, files follow-ups, runs `/update-docs` when the PR diff requires it, captures a retrospective, and prints the session summary.

If there are additional open issues suitable for immediate work and the session is still productive, loop back to Phase 1 with the next issue. Otherwise, wind down.

## Session Wind-Down Protocol

When the pipeline reaches a natural stopping point (after Phase 4) or is forced to stop early:

1. **Commit all work** — never leave uncommitted changes. Use descriptive commit messages.
2. **Push the branch** — even for incomplete work, push so progress is preserved remotely.
3. **Create breadcrumbs** — for any unfinished work, file GitHub issues with:
   - What was attempted
   - What failed or remains
   - Suggested next approach
4. **Clean local state** — delete merged branches, pop any stashes created during the session.
5. **Print session summary**:
   - Issues completed (with PR links)
   - Issues created (with links)
   - Outstanding work (with issue links)

## Guardrails

- **Hard stops** (truly irreversible risk): security vulnerabilities being shipped, data loss paths, force-push to protected branches
- **Soft stops** (proceed with documentation): ambiguous requirements (make assumption, document it), public API changes (implement with deprecation path, flag in PR), exhausted retries (commit progress, file follow-up issue)
- **Never**: force-push, rewrite published history, create PR with known security issues, delete remote branches that aren't yours
- Everything else runs autonomously.
