Refactor the target specified in $ARGUMENTS. Run autonomously — do not pause for plan approval.

## Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Detect repo**: Run `git remote get-url origin` to identify the target repo.
2. Read the target file(s) and all files that import/depend on them
3. For large refactors spanning multiple modules, spawn parallel explorer subagents to investigate each module's dependencies and usage patterns simultaneously
4. Measure current state: line count, function count, nesting depth, number of parameters
5. Identify: repeated patterns, unused code, unnecessary abstractions, tight coupling

### Phase 2: Plan-Critique Loop
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b refactor/<short-description>` where `<short-description>` is a kebab-case summary derived from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Build a refactoring plan (what changes, what's preserved, expected impact) via TodoWrite.
3. Self-critique the plan (general critique mode): evaluate risks, coupling, test coverage gaps, API contract changes.
4. Refine and re-critique until verdict reaches **SOUND** (max 3 iterations).
5. If NEEDS REFINEMENT after 3 iterations: proceed with best version, document caveats in PR. If RETHINK: file follow-up issue and wind down.

### Phase 3: Implement
1. Make single, focused changes — one concern per commit
2. For independent refactoring tasks across different files, use parallel coder subagents (in worktrees)
3. Run tests after each change per the project's CLAUDE.md (test command, lint command)
4. If tests fail after a change, fix and re-test before proceeding (max 2 cycles)

### Phase 4: Ship → `/ship`

Run `/ship`. It runs the pre-push critique gate, all quality gates, updates CHANGELOG, pushes the branch, creates the PR, and auto-merges.

When `/ship` builds the PR body, populate the Summary bullets with the refactoring metrics (lines/complexity before/after), API changes (if any) under Known Limitations, and downstream risks.

### Phase 5: Finish → `/finish`

Run `/finish` (no issue number — refactors typically don't map to a tracked issue, and `/finish` handles the no-issue case by skipping the close step). It deletes branches, runs `/update-docs` to sync docs, captures a retrospective, and prints the session summary.

### Phase 6: Report
Output as the final session line:
- **PR URL**: Link to the merged (or open) PR
- **Summary**: What changed and why
- **Metrics**: Lines of code before/after, complexity before/after
- **Test results**: All passing
- **Risks**: Anything downstream code should know about

## Constraints
- If refactoring changes public API contracts: implement with a deprecation path (keep old signature as a wrapper), flag the API change prominently in the PR body under "API Changes", and file a follow-up issue for removing the deprecated path
- Never refactor without passing tests as a safety net
- One focused change at a time — no big bang rewrites
- If tests don't exist for the target, write characterization tests first

### Next steps
- Run `/finish <#>` after merge to close the issue and clean up branches
- Or run `/orient` to see what to work on next
